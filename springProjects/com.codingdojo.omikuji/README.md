We all want more vacation days and this for will tell you how! ....k, not really but I wish :)

Exploring how to pass form data back and forth between pages. And they almost got me. The dashboard doesn't give you all the information, and they left out the part about saving all your data to sessions and then catching them on the next route. But I think I figured it out and its working!

I also made a route to clear the session so you can play the game again!

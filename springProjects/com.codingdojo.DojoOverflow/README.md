# Dojo Overflow

UM! I think my brain is dead after this one. I'm glad I had all review day to do it, because I learned a ton, almost gave up a dozen times, but in the end got it! SO HAPPY!

full crud, login / registraion, M:M ,M:1, edit, update, ect!

and I don't even care that it looks like garabage! I'm so proud
